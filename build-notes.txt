Garamond installation for LaTeX: sudo getnonfreefonts-sys garamond

Garamond installation for LilyPond:

sudo apt-get install enscript
mkdir ~/.fonts/afm
cd ~/.fonts/afm
[copy .pfb, .pfm, .afm files hither]
mkfontscale
mkfontdir
mkafmmap *
fc-cache -f -v

[scale/dir perhaps inverted? See
http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=452955]

make.sh is not a proper makefile: a manual rm -r out/* is often necessary. (Or
perhaps just rm out/jack-frost-book.tex sometimes?)
