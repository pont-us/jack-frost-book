* TODO Upton-upon-Severn tradition?
Check what tradition, if any, Upton-upon-Severn fits into.
* TODO Hindley street origin
  Where's Hindley Street from? Is it definitely Border? Doesn't seem to
  be a very well-known dance.
* TODO Fix Dilwyn chords (more Cs).
* TODO Use revision date, not build date, in output
  The current LaTeX source uses the datetime package to insert the
  current date under the document. However, it doesn't make much sense
  to use the build date for this: it should be the current repository
  revision date.
